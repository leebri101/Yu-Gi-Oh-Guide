# **Yu-Gi-Oh guide for new/returning players**
## **Site Overview**
Kazuki Takahashi born on October 4th 1961 was a well known manga, author illustrator of the popular series Yu-Gi-Oh,  whom died in diving incident on the 4th of July 2022 saving a woman and her 11 year old daugther and Major Robert Borgeau who was as a diving instructor on the coast of Okinawa Island. Kazuki was who is known for creating the well known anime series of Yu-Gi-Oh (2000), Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's (2008) and Yu-Gi-Oh Zexel (2011) and  appeared as a regular feature in the magazine Shonen Jump in 1996. With the popularity of the series of teenage fans it inspired Kazuki to create the Official Card Game (OCG) which was first introduced in Japan and Trading Card Game (TCG) which was later introduced in the West, where it allowed players to duel with numerical valued ability cards against each other, following in the success of the hugely successful Pok√©mon TCG.

### **Color Scheme:**
 * When creating the intial overall design of the site I have decided to use this colour scheme to go with the overall Yugioh to make it look more mysterious and within the color scheme of the cards from monster effects, to spells, traps and the newer cards which Konami have introduced, for example; XYZ , Synchro and Link monsters.
