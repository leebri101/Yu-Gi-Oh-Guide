            <h2>Card-Effects</h2>
            <br>
                <h4>Continuous-Effect</h4>
                    <p>This effect is active when the Effect Mosnter is face-up on the field & ends once the monster is gone or no longer face-up.</p>
                    <p>All continuous monster effect cards have no trigger for its activation.</p>
                    <p>Perfect if you need to protect these key cards for your strategy.</p>
                    <p class="box">Example:-This card gains 300 ATK for each "Dark Magician" or "Magician of Black Chaos" in either player's Graveyard.</p>
            <br>   
                <h4>Ignition-Effect</h4>
                    <p>You can use these types of card effects by declaring its activation during your Main Phase.</p> 
                    <p>There are some cards which require a cost to activate the effect such as; discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.</p>
                    <p>You can choose when you want activate these this effect, as it allows it to create an easy combo.</p>
                    <p class="box">Example:-Once per turn you can toss a coin and call it. If you call it right, inflict 1000 DMG to your opponent. If you call it wrong, you tak 1000 DMG.</p>
            <br>
                <h4>Trigger-Effect</h4>
                    <p>These card effects only activated during specific times of the duel.</p> 
                    <p>Such as the during the "Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed”.</p> 
                    <p>These types of cards are good for combos but leave you vunerable as it allows your opponent to predict what will happen.</p>
                    <p class="box">Example:- If a LVL 5 or higher monster is Special Summoned: Tribute this face-up card; destroy that LVL 5 or higher monster.</p>
            <br>
                <h4>Quick-Effect</h4>
                    <p>These card effects can be activated even during your opponent's turn.</p>
                    <p>These cards are perfect as your opponent can't predict it when it will occur and can come with a nasty effect.</p>
                    <p class="box">Example:- When your opponent activates a Trap Card (Quick Effect): You can send this card and 1 other Fairy monster from your hand to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it.</p>
            <br>
                <h4>Flip-Effect</h4>
                    <p>Flip effect cards are part of a Trigger Effect.</p> 
                    <p>These cards effects are only activated when the face-down card is attacked while face-down.</p>
                    <p>This can also happen when it is Flip Summoned or flipped face-up by a card effect.</p>
                    <p>These card effects start with the word "FLIP" on the card.</p>
                    <p>These cards are also great for getting yourself out of a pinch, and for allowing your opponent to risk guessing if it's Flip effect or not.</p>
                    <p class="box">Example:-FLIP: You can target 1 Level 4 or lower Spellcaster monster in your GY; Special Summon that target.</p>
