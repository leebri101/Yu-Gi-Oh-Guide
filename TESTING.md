## **During Development Testing**
In the development phase, I was manually testing the site in two ways:-
    
1. Publishing the page via GitHub and sharing it with friends and family to test within a set controlled environment, and receive feedback on major and small changes that needed to be rectified.

1. Self testing to ensure that "I" as the creator know what to expect of the site.

### **Manual Testing**
* During the testing phase , I used three different browsers to ensure consistency & cross-platform connectivity. The browsers used in the tests are:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Edge

* I also used devtools to experiment the different screen sizes and devices from 320 px up to 4000px in width. 
* I have also asked a small group of people to test the site using Apple & Android products using safari. The users reported back with no issues or bugs only styling suggestions which will be implimented in the near future.
