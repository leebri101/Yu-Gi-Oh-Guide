# Testing Page of Contents
## **During Development Testing**
In the development phase, I was manually testing the site in two ways:-
    
1. Publishing the page via GitHub and sharing it with friends and family to test within a set controlled environment, and receive feedback on major and small changes that needed to be rectified.

1. Self testing to ensure that "I" as the creator know what to expect of teh site.

### **Manual Tesing**
* During the testing phase , I used three different browsers to ensure consistency and cross-platform connectivity. The browsers used in the tests are:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Edge

* I also used devtools to experiment the different screen sizes and devices from 320 px up to 4000px in width. 
* In addition to this, I also asked several people to test using iPhones and Apple Mac laptops/desktops using safari. These users reported no issues or bugs only style suggestions.
